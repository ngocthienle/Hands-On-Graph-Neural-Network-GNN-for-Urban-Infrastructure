# GNN for Urban Infrastructure Analysis: Full Learning Series

Welcome to the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Urban Infrastructure Analysis series. This learning suite is designed to help urban planners, data scientists, and researchers apply GNNs to critical infrastructure domains including roads, water systems, smart buildings, and urban environmental monitoring.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
1. Understand GNN foundations and spatial graph construction
2. Apply GNNs to road, water, disaster, energy, and sensor networks
3. Evaluate infrastructure performance, forecasting, and resilience
4. Build practical, Jupyter-based GNN workflows for academic or city-level analysis
